<!-- THE BEGINNING -->
    <div class="the-idea">
      <h2 class="title">Where BookMark Began</h2>
      <p class="bodycopy">Let me take you back in time for a minute. It's September of 2023 and I have just begun reading <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em>, the first in a five book series by Sarah J. Maas. Little did I know she has written two other series, <em>Throne of Glass</em> and <em>Crescent City</em>, which I promptly picked up and read as soon as I could. Fast forward four months and I'm now starting my Spring 2024 courses along with what feels like an incurable book hangover after finishing all 16 books in the Sarah J. Maas universe.</p>
      <p>With my UX Design course in full swing, we are all tasked with brainstorming ideas and creating a project that incorporates using UX research and design. At this point in time, books are still the only thing on my mind so I considered how I might use that to my advantage for this project. I could not stop thinking about reading, so how I could I make reading my homework? Well, a re-read of course. Now picture me sitting at my desk with a lightbulb illuminating above my head – a book app! More specifically, a note-taking app, because for said re-read I want to take notes but I <u>do not</u> want to mark up my physical books.</p>

    </div>


<!-- THE PROBLEM -->
  <div class="the-problem">
    <p>So there poses my problem: How can I keep my books looking like the image above, even after taking notes?</p>
    <p>This problem is two-fold, not only was I looking for a way to take notes outside of the pages, I also knew it would be important that those notes were available for easy future reference. And so, the first stages of BookMark research and prototyping began. I started out by turning my problem statement into a question as follows:</p>
    <div class="callouts">
      <h2 class="callouts">How can I efficiently and digitally take notes with the intention of easy reference in the future?</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- UX DESIGN -->
  <div class="uxdesign">
    <div>
      <h2 class="title">Research</h2>
      <p class="bodycopy">Before I could dig into the best part (designing), I had to do some research. Who would use a book note-taking app? Why would people use it? How would they want to use it? Do people other than myself even take notes when they read? I had an endless stream of questions, so I conducted interviews with a handful people who I would consider potential users. From this small sample group, I was able to articulate what type of person does take notes and better understand how a note-taking flow would appeal to them. I also conducted market research to see what exists already that potentially solves this problem.</p>

    <div>
      <p class="bodycopy">As I continued through spring semester, I frequently brought the prototype to peers and users for feedback. Getting different perspectives on the user flow, thoughts about functionality that was missing (or overkill), and playing with new ideas to add, was integral to bringing BookMark to a place where it could be ready if I decided to make it my Capstone project. Below you can see the hero image of BookMark's app for my final presentation in May.</p>

  <!-- REBRANDING -->
  <div class="rebranding">
    <div>
      <h2 class="title">Rebranding</h2>
      <p class="bodycopy">During the summer semester, I decided I wanted to move forward with BookMark as my Capstone project. With this in mind, I leveraged an assignment in my Experiment Interaction class to give BookMark some very needed branding updates. The assignment was to create a dynamic brand identity, and in order to do that with BookMark, it <em>needed</em> a brand. There were fonts and colors picked out, sure, but there wasn't a strong identity for BookMark yet, so I began there.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="bodycopy">After deciding on the final logo (can you spot it?), I began figuring out how I could make it dynamic. This led me to the idea of creating a marketing campaign that targeted users based on their favorite genres to read.</p>
