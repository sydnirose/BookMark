                note-taking methods that allow for an organized, customizable, and intuitive experience, and explores how to remedy that lack through research, design and community.

<!-- THE BEGINNING -->
    <div class="the-idea">
      <h2 class="callouts">Where BookMark Began</h2>
      <p class="the-idea">Let me take you back in time for a minute. It's September of 2023 and I have just begun reading <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses</em>, the first in a five book series by Sarah J. Maas. Little did I know she has written two other series, <em>Throne of Glass</em> and <em>Crescent City</em>, which I promptly picked up and read as soon as I could. Fast forward four months and I'm now starting my Spring 2024 courses along with what feels like an incurable book hangover after finishing all 16 books in the Sarah J. Maas universe.</p>
      <p>With my UX Design course in full swing, we are all tasked with brainstorming ideas and creating a project that incorporates using UX research and design. At this point in time, books are still the only thing on my mind so I considered how I might use that to my advantage for this project. I could not stop thinking about reading, so how I could I make reading my homework? Well, a re-read of course. Now picture me sitting at my desk with a lightbulb illuminating above my head – a book app! More specifically, a note-taking app, because for said re-read, I want to take notes but I <u>do not</u> want to mark up my physical books.</p>
